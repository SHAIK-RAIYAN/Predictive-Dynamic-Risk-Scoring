### 3. Machine Learning Models

**Implemented Algorithms:**

#### Isolation Forest
- Anomaly detection for risk scoring
- Configurable parameters (n_estimators, max_samples, contamination)
- Real-time anomaly score calculation
- Feature extraction from user and event data

#### Random Forest
- Risk level classification (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- Bootstrap sampling for model training
- Gini impurity for split optimization
- Ensemble prediction for robust results

**Feature Engineering:**
- Entity-based features (age, activity score, risk score)
- Event-based features (login failures, privilege escalations, file transfers)
- Time-based features (recent activity, after-hours activity, weekend activity)
- Severity-based features (high severity events, average severity)
- Network features (unique IPs, port scans)
- File system features (large transfers, data volume)

### 4. Sample Data Generation

**Users:**
- 5 sample users with realistic profiles
- Different risk levels and departments
- Realistic risk scores and activity patterns

**Risk Events:**
- 5 sample security events
- Various event types (login failures, privilege escalations, file transfers)
- Different severity levels and timestamps
- Realistic source IPs and locations

**Analytics:**
- Daily analytics data
- Event counts and risk distributions
- Top threats and active user metrics

### 5. Live Monitoring Dashboard

**Real-time Components:**
- Live monitoring toggle with status indicators
- Real-time metrics (active users, recent events, high-risk users)
- Live risk score updates
- Real-time event streaming
- User risk distribution charts

**Monitoring Features:**
- Toggle monitoring on/off
- Real-time data refresh
- Status indicators and alerts
- Performance metrics
- Last updated timestamps

  // Model Information
  getModelInfo()
}
```
